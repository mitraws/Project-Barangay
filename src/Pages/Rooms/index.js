          Our non smoking double or twin rooms are decorated in a quirky,
          tropical, S/E Asian style. Both rooms have large en-suite bathrooms
          with showers and bathtubs. Unique among B&B's, we have Japanese bidet
          toilets for complete hygiene. Rooms are on the first and second floor.
          Like monumental houses in Amsterdam, we have steep narrow stairs, the
          B&B is not suitable to those physicaly challenged.
